# Heirloom Havoc
Heirloom Havoc is a horror party game akin to Among Us, but with PS1-era 3D graphics and every player has a different toolkit.
This means that the killer can be any of the family members and the players have to manage to solve the mystery or brutally massacre the rest of the family with the tools they're given. It might be easy for the funny uncle, but grandpa who is stuck to his bed and on the brink of death might be a bit more challenging.

The game features crusty low-poly graphics, a Resident Evil/Silent Hill -eque camera and beautifully enraging tank controls.
This is my biggest challenge yet. GameMaker is not recommended to make 3D games in, and multiplayer is a beast I haven't dared to handle yet.
